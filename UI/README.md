# N-Network Analysis: UI
This is an Web Application UI required to visualize the data.

The UI presents the average throughput on the graphs presented, displaying three line graphs: the first two are two separate connections and the third being a combination of both these connections. Just below that graph, the user is able to select one of the three aforementioned line graphs separately, viewing average throughput data on a connection-specific basis.
Uses morris.js to graph the data
